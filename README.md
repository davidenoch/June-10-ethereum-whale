# An Ethereum Whale Story

I recently dusted off my blockchain analytics cap to see if it is still a good fit. I started checking out some of the showcased dashboards and I came across the useful [State of Ethereum Dashboard](https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/flipsideteam/state-of-ethereum-dashboard-QfmrUm). This was made a few months back, but it has parameters for date ranges, so I decided to plug in some earlier dates.

## The "Live" Dashboard â€“ a blessing and a curse
It is always advised to make your dashboards be "alive" over time. Especially with a mega-dashboard, such as this one. You don't want to fix your analysis to a fixed time range. It should stay relevant over time. 

The only problem is that, over time, some strange outlier like behaviors can ruin the effectiveness of our charts. Such was the case, when something happened this last June 10, 2024.
